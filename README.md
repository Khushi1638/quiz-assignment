## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered a challenge with the API link provided. The original API link did not work as expected, so I had to find and use an alternative API link to fetch the quiz questions. This required additional time and effort to ensure the new API was properly integrated and functioning correctly.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the quiz assignment is functional, there are several areas where it can be improved:

- **User Interface**: The UI could be significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience. This includes developing a mobile-friendly version to ensure the quiz is accessible on all devices.
- **Bug Fixes**: There is a known bug in the application that needs to be addressed. Future updates will focus on identifying and fixing this issue.
- **Additional Features**: Starting late on the project limited the scope of features. In future iterations, I plan to add more features to make the quiz more engaging and interactive.

These improvements will be prioritized in future updates to ensure a better overall experience for users.
